# 🏡 California Housing Prices – Data Visualization

This project explores and visualizes the [California Housing Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) using Python. It focuses on understanding key features and relationships that influence housing prices in California.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and geographic patterns
- Analyzed attributes like median income, housing age, location, and house values
- Cleaned missing data and prepared the dataset for future modeling tasks

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 📁 File

- `visualizing the data.ipynb`: Contains all data visualization and insights

## 📌 Dataset Source

[California Housing Prices – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Feature engineering and scaling
- Machine Learning model for price prediction
- Deployment of the model via web interface (Flask/Streamlit)
